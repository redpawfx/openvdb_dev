                      OpenVDB Development Repository
========================================================================

This GitHub repository hosts the trunk of the OpenVDB development. This implies
that it is the newest public version with the latest features and bug fixes.
However, it also means that it has not undergone a lot of testing and is
generally less stable than  the production releases that we will continue to
deliver as tar-balls at www.openvdb.org/download

Since we're still working on a Contributor Licence Agreement this GitHub
repository is currently read-only.

For documentation of the library and code examples see:
